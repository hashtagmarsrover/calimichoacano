2.2.1 Electromagnetic (EM) radiation
EM radiation is the energy transmitted through space in wave form, which can be
characterized in terms of a wavelength λ or a frequency f.
2.2.2 RF antenna
An antenna is a device used to emit and receive radiofrequency (RF) waves. As an
emitter, it transforms high frequency signals traveling on a conductor into
electromagnetic (EM) waves in free space.
2.2.3 Radiofrequency
Radiofrequency is a frequency within the electromagnetic spectrum used for radio
transmission. For purposes of this toolkit, the frequency range of interest is 100 kHz
to 300 GHz, as shown in Table 1.1

Figure 1. Wave Characteristics
2.2.5 Frequency of RF waves
Frequency of RF waves is the number of EM waves passing a given point in one second.
The frequency is expressed in Hertz (Hz).
2.2.6 Bandwidth of an RF antenna
The bandwidth of an antenna refers to the range of frequencies over which the antenna
operates correctly.
RF Toolkit–BCCDC/NCCEH Section 2 10
2.2.7 Power density
Power density is the power per unit area perpendicular to the direction of propagation,
usually expressed in terms of Watts per square meter (W/m2
) or milliWatts per
centimeter-squared (mW/cm2
).
2.2.8 Decibel (dB)
A decibel is a measure of the increase or decrease in power, P, at two points 1 and 2
expressed in logarithmic form:
Power Ratio in dB = 10Log �
P1
P2
� (2.1)
• Decibel-milliwatt (dBm):
Electrical power unit in decibels referenced to 1milliWatt (mW), as expressed below:
P(dBm) = 10Log[
P(mW)
1 mW ] (2.2)
• Decibel-Watt (dBW):
Electrical power unit in decibels referenced to 1Watt (W), as expressed below:
P(dBW) = 10Log[
P(W)
1 W ] (2.3)
2.2.9 Antenna gain/loss in dBi
This is the antenna’s gain or loss G over a theoretical isotropic antenna (radiating
evenly in all directions).
𝐺𝑎𝑖𝑛 𝐺 (𝑑𝐵) = 10𝐿𝑜𝑔(
𝑃1
𝑃2
) (2.4)
Where:
 P1 is the power from the antenna at a point X in space.
 P2 is the power from a hypothetical isotropic radiator at the same point X.
Example:
If an antenna has a gain G of 6 dBi in a certain direction, it means that the power of the
transmitter is multiplied by 4, as shown below:
𝑃1
𝑃2
= 𝐼𝑛𝑣 [𝐿𝑜𝑔10 � 6
10�] = 100.6 = 4 (2.5)
2.2.10 Equivalent isotropically radiated power (EIRP)
The equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) is defined as the product of the power
supplied to the antenna 𝐏𝐭 and the antenna gain 𝐆𝐭, both quantities expressed in
linear terms (not in decibels):
𝐄𝐈𝐑𝐏 (𝐖) = 𝐏𝐭 (𝐖) .𝐆𝐭 (2.6)
RF Toolkit–BCCDC/NCCEH Section 2 11
It is the power that would be radiated by an isotropic source if it had an input power
equal to 𝐏𝐭 𝐆𝐭.
In equation (2.6), 𝐄𝐈𝐑𝐏 and 𝐏𝐭 are expressed in units of Watt while 𝐆𝐭 is
dimensionless.
In decibels (dimensionless), EIRP is equal to the sum of 𝐏𝐭 (dBW) and 𝐆𝐭 (dBi):
𝐄𝐈𝐑𝐏(𝐝𝐁𝐖) = 𝐏𝐭(𝐝𝐁𝐖) + 𝐆𝐭(𝐝𝐁𝐢) (2.7)
Example:
Suppose 𝐏𝐭 = 20 Watt and the antenna Gain 𝐆𝐭=5
• In units of Watt, EIRP is equal to: 20 W x 5 = 100 W
• In units of decibel-power (dimensionless):
𝐏𝐭 (dBw) = 10 Log (20) = 13.01
𝐆𝐭 (dBi) = 10 Log (5) = 6.99
Therefore: 𝐄𝐈𝐑𝐏 (𝐝𝐁𝐖) = 𝟏𝟎 𝐋𝐨𝐠 (𝟐𝟎) + 𝟏𝟎 𝐋𝐨𝐠 (𝟓) = 𝟏𝟑. 𝟎𝟏 + 𝟔. 𝟗𝟗 = 𝟐𝟎 dBw (2.8)
Note: In equations (2.6) and (2.7), signal losses in cables are assumed negligible.
2.2.11 Continuous RF wave (CW)
A continuous radiofrequency wave is a RF signal that is not altered by modulation. It is
therefore is described by a constant frequency, constant amplitude, and steadily
advancing phase. In other words, continuous waves are successive oscillations which
are identical under steady-state conditions.
2.2.12 Modulation of RF waves
Wave modulation occurs when some characteristic of the wave is varied.
a. Pulse modulation:
In pulse modulation, pulsed waves are emitted in short pulses, i.e., RF energy is
rapidly switched ON and OFF, as shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2. Pulsed waves
RF Toolkit–BCCDC/NCCEH Section 2 12
For example, Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology uses
eight slots. The assignment of one slot per user gives rise to the pulsed nature of
the wave; a GSM phone will only be transmitting 1/8th of the time, i.e., 1/8th duty
cycle.

Other examples: keyless entry, pulsed NMR systems, analog or digital radar for
airports, ships, speed detection, military, satellites, electronic test equipment.
b. Amplitude modulation:
RF waves are continuously emitted with changing energy (amplitude), as shown in
Figure 3.
Figure 3. Amplitude-modulated waves
Examples of amplitude modulation: AM radio, amateur radio.
c. Frequency modulation:
RF waves have constant amplitude with change of frequency in small amounts, as
shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Frequency-modulated waves
Examples of frequency modulation: FM radio, amateur radio, data and fax modems,
telemetry, radar, seismic prospecting and newborn EEG seizure monitoring3

2.2.13 Electric field
The region surrounding an electric charge, in which the magnitude and direction of the
force on a hypothetical test charge is defined at any point. The electric field produces a
force on electrically charged objects.
RF Toolkit–BCCDC/NCCEH Section 2 13
Electric field strength E:
The magnitude of the electric field vector (in units of Volts/meter, V/m)
Magnetic field:
A force field associated with changing electric fields (when electric charges are in
motion). Magnetic fields exert deflective forces on moving electric charges.
A magnetic field can be specified in two ways: as magnetic flux density B or
magnetic field strength H.
Magnetic flux density B:
B is the amount of magnetic flux through a unit area taken perpendicular to the
direction of the magnetic flux, in SI units of Tesla (T) or CGS units of Gauss (G).
1 Gauss = 10−4Tesla = 100µTesla (2.9)
Magnetic field strength H:
H is the magnitude of the magnetic field vector (in units of Amperes/meter, A/m)
Relation between B and H:
The two quantities are related by the expression:
𝐵 = µ𝐻 (2.10)
Where µ is the magnetic permeability. In a vacuum and in air, as well as in nonmagnetic (including biological) materials, µ has the value 4π 10-7 expressed in
units of Henry per meter (H.m-1
). Therefore, a magnetic field can be described by
either of the two quantities, B or H.
2.2.14 Power density in the far field
The power density S is the product of the electric field E and the magnetic field H:
𝑆 = 𝐸. 𝐻 (2.11)
In the far field, an estimate of the RF power density can be determined by means of the
following equation1
:
𝑆 = 𝑃𝑡 𝐺𝑚𝑎𝑥𝛿 𝛾
4𝜋𝑅2 (2.12)
Where:
 S is the power density (Watt/m2
)
 𝑃𝑡 is the power of the transmitter (Watt)
 𝐺𝑚𝑎𝑥 the maximum Gain of the antenna (dimensionless)
RF Toolkit–BCCDC/NCCEH Section 2 14
 𝛿 the duty cycle of the RF source (dimensionless)
 𝛾 a factor that accounts for possible ground reflections (dimensionless)
 𝑅 the distance from the RF source (meters)
2.2.15 Root- mean- square (rms) Electric (E) and magnetic (H) fields
This is the square root of the average of the squares of the instantaneous E field or H
field taken over a time interval.
For example, if n values E1, E2, … En of the electric field are recorded during an
interval of time, the rms electric field current is calculated as follows:
𝑟𝑚𝑠 𝐸 = �1
𝑛 (𝐸1
2 + 𝐸2
2 + 𝐸3
2 + ⋯ 𝐸𝑛
2) (2.13)
Similarly, the rms magnetic field is:
𝑟𝑚𝑠 𝐻 = �1
𝑛 (𝐻1
2 + 𝐻2
2 + 𝐻3
2 + ⋯ 𝐻𝑛
2) (2.14)
2.3 General Properties of RF Waves4
RF waves are EM waves that:
• can be found in nature or be man-made
• propagate in free air and dense media. Their propagation obeys the inverse square
law at sufficient distance from the antenna (far field).
• travel at the speed of light (300,000 Km/second)
• carry energy as they propagate
• can transfer their energy to matter
• can be used to carry information
• can be broadcast outwards to reach many locations or can be formed into beams to
reach a particular spot
• can be reflected or refracted when interacting with a dense medium
• can travel great distances
• travel in straight lines
• can pass through walls
• can be captured by placing a metal rod, a loop, parabolic metal dish, or horn in
its path.
2.4 RF Fields
The electromagnetic field is composed of an electric field E and a magnetic field H.
They both produce forces on electric charges.
RF Toolkit–BCCDC/NCCEH Section 2 15
Static electrical charges produce an electric field while charges in motion produce a
magnetic field.
A changing magnetic field can move electric charges to induce currents in its
interaction with a medium.
An RF wave is a moving electromagnetic field that has velocity in the direction of travel
and components of electric field E and magnetic field H arranged at right angles to
each other (Figure 5). The RF field transmits and receives RF energy through free
space.
Figure 5. Schematic representation of the propagation of RF waves
2.5 RF Waves in the Electromagnetic Spectrum
RF waves are part of the electromagnetic spectrum in the frequency range of 300 Hertz
(Hz) to 300 Gigahertz (GHz), as shown below (Figure 6).

2.6 Characteristics of RF Fields
EM waves have a wavelength and a frequency related by:
λ =
c
f 2.15)
Where:
 c is the velocity of light = 3 108 m/s= 300,000 Kilometers per second (km/s)
 f is the frequency in Hertz (or sec-1)
 λ is the wavelength in meters (m)
RF waves can propagate through various media, particularly air. Their propagation
characteristics depend on their frequency f (or wavelengthλ ) but also on the physical
properties of the absorbing media. The speed of an RF wave in a vacuum is equal to
the speed of light.
RF emitters transmit their signals in either Continuous Wave (CW) mode or Pulsed Wave
(PW) mode.
In a CW mode, the waves are emitted in a continuous command. The power output of a
continuous system is expressed in terms of average power.
In a PW mode, the waves are emitted in short pulses repeated at regular intervals. The
output of a pulsed system is expressed in terms of peak power. The average power for
a pulsed system is:
Pavg = DcPmax (2.16)
Where:
 P
avg
is the average power in Watts (W)
 Dc is the duty cycle (dimensionless)
 Pmax is the peak power in Watts (W)
2.7 Production of RF: RF Antennas
RF fields are produced by RF antennas. The role an RF antenna is to focus and intensify
the initially generated waves. Two types of antennas are usually used for the
production of RF: stationary antennas and rotating antennas.
2.7.1 Stationary antennas
Stationary antennas are fixed antennas. They are widely used for radio broadcasting,
mobile phones and base stations, FM radios, Wifi systems, cordless phones, GPS, etc.
The size of the antenna is much larger than the wavelength λ of the emitted waves.
RF Toolkit–BCCDC/NCCEH Section 2 17
The antenna focuses the original RF signal into narrow and intense RF beams. The
focusing potential of the antenna is quantified by its Gain G which is a measure of the
proportion of the input power that is concentrated in a particular direction.
The RF waves generated by an antenna have different properties at varying distances
from the RF source.
Three regions are commonly considered in the path of RF fields (Figure 7):
 The Near Field (nf)
 The Intermediate Field (if) also known as the Fresnel region
 The Far Field (ff) also known as the Fraunhofer region
"Near, Intermediate, and Far Fields", used for educational and research purposes, courtesy of International
Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (2009).7
Figure 7. Propagation of RF waves
2.7.1.1 The near field
The near field is the EMF that exists at the RF source and extends to a distance of one
wavelength from the antenna.
In this region where the phase differences between waves emitted at different points of
the antenna are relatively large, the relationship between the Electric Field E and the
Magnetic Field H is not well defined.
The near field is divided into two sub-regions:
• The reactive near field where the strength decreases rapidly with distance from
the antenna
• The radiating near field where the average power density remains fairly constant
at different distances from the antenna, with some localized fluctuations.
RF Toolkit–BCCDC/NCCEH Section 2 18
The ideal radiating near field conditions occur at a distance Dnf from the antenna on
the order of:
Dnf =
λ
2π
(2.17)
Where λ is the wavelength of the RF wave.
For example if the frequency of the RF wave is 900 MHz (i.e., λ =33 cm), the distance
Dnf is about 5 cm.
It is assumed that the near field extends to a distance of the order of one wavelength
λ . In the case of a 900 MHz wave, the near field would extend to a maximum distance
of 33 cm from the antenna.
For large antennas with a dimension D (diameter or largest dimension of the antenna)
larger than one wavelength, the radiating near field region extends from:
𝜆
2𝜋
𝑡𝑜 0.5 𝐷2
𝜆 (2.18)
Regarding the power density of the RF waves in the near field and because of the phase
differences, it is practical to consider that the peak power density all the way through
the near field is four times the average power density of the antenna S0
, as follows:
Snf = 4S0=
4P
A (2.19)
Where:
- P is the power output of the antenna (Watt)
- A is the area of the antenna (m2
)
In the near field region, it is useful to measure the electric field E (in Volts per
meter) and the magnetic field H (in Amperes per meter) and compare the values to
the Limits of Canada Safety Code 6.
The quantities E and H are related as follows:
Z =
E
H (2.20)
Where Z is the impedance in air, in units of Ohms (Ω).
The value of the impedance Z is not constant in the near field. It could be lower than
377 Ohms if the predominant field is magnetic and larger than 377 Ohms if the
predominant field is electric.
RF Toolkit–BCCDC/NCCEH Section 2 19
2.7.1.2 The intermediate field
It starts after the near field and ends before the start of the far field. In this region,
because of the phase differences between waves, the RF power density alternates
between maximum and minimum levels in a similar way to the near field. Therefore,
the power density in the intermediate field also follows Equation (2.20).
The intermediate field extends from 0.5 D²/λ to 2D²/λ where D is the largest linear
aperture dimension of the antenna and λ the wavelength of the wave.
2.7.1.3 The far field
The far field is the electromagnetic field located beyond the near field. It starts at a
distance Dff from the antenna defined as follows:
Dff =
2D2
λ (2.21)
(Note that in Canada Safety Code 6 it is recommended taking Dff as 0.5D²/λ meaning
that the intermediate field could be considered part of the far field).
In the far field, the electric field E and the magnetic field H are orthogonal and the free
space impedance is equal to 377 Ω. Therefore, the relation between E and H in the far
field is:
𝑍0 = 𝐸
𝐻 = 377 (2.22)
Consequently, the power density in the far field is equal to:
𝑆 = 𝐸. 𝐻 = 𝑬𝟐
𝟑𝟕𝟕 = 377𝐻2 (2.23)
In the far field, the measurement of only one quantity, E or H or S, is enough. The
other quantities can be calculated by means of equation (2.23).
2.7.2 Rotating antennas
Rotating antennas transmit RF waves in a given direction part of the time. This type of
antennas is usually used for search and detection purposes, e.g., rada
